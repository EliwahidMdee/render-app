## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] View dashboard with statistics
- [ ] Filter sessions by date range (Today, Last Week, etc.)
- [ ] Click on Pending/Active/Resolved cards to see filtered sessions
- [ ] Navigate to a session and view chat
- [ ] Verify WhatsApp-style message layout (agent left, user right)
- [ ] Send a message and verify it appears correctly
- [ ] Check message status ticks (grey/blue)
- [ ] Verify auto-refresh is working (messages update automatically)
- [ ] Check session time display is accurate
- [ ] Verify profile header shows correct name and email
- [ ] Test settings button (shows "Coming soon" message)
- [ ] Test navigation between Dashboard and Sessions
- [ ] Test back navigation from filtered sessions
- [ ] Test pull-to-refresh on dashboard and sessions
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Verify push notifications are received (if backend is ready)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Logo:** Requires user to add logo.png file manually
2. **Settings Screen:** Not implemented yet (shows "Coming soon" message)
3. **WebSocket:** Currently uses polling (800ms) instead of WebSocket for real-time updates
4. **Backend APIs:** New APIs need to be implemented on the backend
5. **Flutter/Dart Not Available:** Could not run `flutter analyze` or test compilation in this environment

---

## Next Steps

1. Add your logo to `assets/images/logo.png`
2. Implement the backend APIs from `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
3. Run `flutter pub get` to ensure dependencies are installed
4. Run `flutter analyze` to check for any issues
5. Test on a physical device or emulator
6. Implement settings screen (future enhancement)
7. Consider WebSocket for true real-time updates (future enhancement)

---

## Code Quality

- ✅ Follows existing code style and patterns
- ✅ Uses Riverpod for state management
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Reusable widgets
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Documented code where necessary
- ✅ Minimal changes to existing code

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Auto-Refresh Rate:** 800ms polling might be aggressive for some use cases
   - Consider implementing exponential backoff when idle
   - Consider switching to WebSocket in production

2. **Dashboard Statistics:** Should be cached on backend
   - Recommend 5-minute cache TTL

3. **Message List:** Currently loads all messages
   - Consider implementing pagination for very long conversations

---

## Security Notes

- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- FCM tokens should be encrypted in database
- Session access is validated on backend
- No sensitive data exposed in logs

---

**Implementation Date:** January 2024  
**Flutter Version:** >=3.0.0 <4.0.0  
**Status:** ✅ All requirements implemented
