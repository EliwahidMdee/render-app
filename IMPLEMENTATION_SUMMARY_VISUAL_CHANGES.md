### 4. Timezone Fix ✅
**Files Modified:**

- `lib/features/chat/presentation/widgets/message_bubble.dart`

**Changes:**
- Added `_toLocal()` helper function to convert UTC timestamps to local time
- All date/time formatting now automatically converts UTC to local timezone
- Message timestamps in chat bubbles now display in user's local time

**Result:** All timestamps now display correctly in the user's local timezone.

### 5. Auto-Refresh Speed Improvement ✅

**Changes:**
- Added Timer for auto-refresh of sessions list
- Refresh interval set to 800ms (under 1 second as required)

## Testing Recommendations

To properly test these changes:

1. **Login Screen:**
   - Test with logo.png in assets/images/
   - Test without logo.png (should show icon fallback)
   - Verify "Agent Portal" text is centered and prominent

2. **Settings Screen:**
   - Open from Dashboard or Sessions List
   - Test Privacy Policy dialog
   - Toggle Dark Mode switch
   - Try editing account (currently shows "coming soon" message)

3. **Messaging:**
   - Send a message and verify it appears immediately with clock icon
   - Watch clock icon change to checkmarks when message is sent
   - Verify user messages show checkmarks (grey → blue when read)
   - Check timestamps are in local time

4. **Auto-Refresh:**
   - Open sessions list and watch it update every 800ms
   - Open chat and watch messages update every 800ms

5. **Colors:**
   - Verify new blue gradient in app bars
   - Check message bubble colors (white for agent, green for user)
   - Verify status badge colors (orange, green, grey)

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

The following were mentioned but marked as "coming soon" or require backend changes:

1. **Full Dark Mode:** Toggle exists but full theme switching needs app-wide state management
2. **Account Editing API:** UI exists but needs backend endpoint
3. **Additional APIs:** May need endpoints from the backend repo

---

## Conclusion

All core visual requirements from the issue have been successfully implemented with minimal, focused changes. The app now has a modern, attractive, WhatsApp-inspired design with better performance, timezone handling, and user experience.
